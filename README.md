# Daily Wellbeing Snapshot: Exploring Factors Affecting Physical and Emotional Health

Health and wellbeing influences everybodyâ€™s life on a daily basis. How we feel throughout each day can influence many different aspects such as school, sports/exercises, social interaction, work, family life, and so much more. As university students, time is limited and it is always a challenge to balance out all these necessities in our daily lives. More often than not, there will be something that is sacrificed. 
Ideally, we live in a perfect world where everything can be balanced out, however we know that reality does not work like that. Our goal for this project is to measure different daily attributes in our lives and see how they impact our daily health and well being. We aim to track different attributes such as sleep duration, food intake, exercise amount, and more, to see how this can affect our daily energy and mood. We hope our findings through this project could help us reflect on our current university student lifestyle and find correlations that can lead to getting the best balance of necessities in our daily lives. 

We used processing to help answer this question.
